# Infant Wearable Project

## Vision
An open-source platform for collecting and analyzing naturalistic infant development data through wearable technology. We're building tools to capture long-form audio, video, and position data from infants in home settings to advance developmental research.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on constructing and benchmarking a comprehensive data analysis pipeline that enables automated recognition of:
- Infant-directed speech (IDS)
- Caregiver interactions and behaviors
- Object references in the infant's environment

Our mission is to create accessible, reproducible, and low-cost tools for developmental researchers worldwide, contributing to a more inclusive, scalable model of early childhood data collection and analysis.

## Current Development Focus
- **Speech Analysis**: Implementing Whisper-based transcription optimized for infant-directed speech
- **Multilingual Benchmarking**: Evaluating ASR performance across Mandarin and English datasets
- **Visual Object Identification**: Detecting and labeling referential objects from video data to connect language input with visual context
